(@smuckola) (aka dtm in IRC) went out into the great wide open of IRC to solicit cross-platform collaboration, and collided with (@ryao), (@lundman), and (@wca).  (@ryao) started investigating the concept of cross-development with the ZFSonLinux community, starting with the idea of the build system.  Instead, (@lundman) ended up joining in with a relentless torrent of spontaneous code.  He forked the github repositories of the Solaris Portability Layer (SPL) and of ZFSonLinux, and began experimenting with porting them.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
